**Topic:** Real-world use case of Claude Code in marketing workflows

## Transcript Summary

A marketing professional at Anthropic shares their experience using Claude Code despite having zero coding background. They literally had to Google "how do I open terminal on Mac" when they started.

### The Problem

The marketer works on:
- Paid social campaigns
- App store creatives
- Visual creatives in Figma (with design team)

**Manual Process (Time-Consuming):**
1. Go into Figma
2. Copy existing frame
3. Paste it multiple times
4. Open Google doc
5. Copy and paste headline variations
6. Repeat back and forth

This became extremely repetitive when creating:
- 10 different variations
- Across 5 different aspect ratios
- Time adds up very quickly

### The Solution - Figma Plugin Built with Claude Code

The marketer used Claude Code to create a Figma plugin that automates the workflow:

**New Process (30 seconds vs 30 minutes):**
1. Select the frame in Figma
2. Open the custom plugin
3. Hit "identify template components"
4. Plugin identifies: headline, CTA, code blocks
5. Select what to update (e.g., headlines)
6. Copy headlines list once
7. Paste into plugin
8. Hit "generate ad variants"
9. All variations created automatically in individual frames

**Result:** 30 minutes → 30 seconds (60x faster)

### Key Takeaways

**For Non-Coders:**
- You don't need to know how to code
- You just need to clearly explain your challenge
- Explain what you're trying to solve in a clear, concise manner

**Getting Started Advice:**
1. Think through repetitive areas of your work
2. Identify tasks that could be automated
3. Start with a very small, easy thing
4. The gap between "I wish this existed" and "I can build this myself" is much smaller than people realize

## Technical Implementation Notes
